# Communication System Performance Guide

## 🚀 Performance Improvements Implemented

This guide covers the performance optimizations implemented for the church dashboard's communication system, including Resend and Africa's Talking integrations.

## 📦 Dependencies Status

### ✅ No Additional Dependencies Required

Your implementation is **excellent** and doesn't require additional packages:

- **Resend Integration**: Uses Laravel's built-in `Http` facade
- **Africa's Talking Integration**: Uses Laravel's built-in `Http` facade
- **Queue System**: Uses Laravel's built-in queue functionality

## 🔧 Performance Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Africa's Talking Method Signature
- **Issue**: Missing `CommunicationSetting $setting` parameter
- **Status**: Already fixed in your codebase

### 2. ✅ Added Retry Logic & Timeouts
- **HTTP Retry**: 3 attempts with 1-second delay
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for all API calls
- **Providers**: Resend, Africa's Talking, Twilio, Mailgun, Postmark

### 3. ✅ Implemented Queue Jobs
Created async job classes for better performance:

#### Job Classes Created:
- `SendSingleEmailJob` - Individual email sending
- `SendSingleSMSJob` - Individual SMS sending  
- `SendBulkEmailJob` - Bulk email processing
- `SendBulkSMSJob` - Bulk SMS processing
- `ProcessCampaignStepJob` - Email campaign processing

#### Job Configuration:
- **Retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds (single), 300 seconds (bulk)
- **Memory**: Chunked processing to prevent memory issues

### 4. ✅ Added Batch Processing
- **Email Campaigns**: Asynchronous batch processing
- **Bulk Communications**: Queue-based bulk operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time batch status monitoring

### 5. ✅ Performance Monitoring
Created comprehensive monitoring system:

#### New Services:
- `CommunicationPerformanceService` - Performance metrics
- `CommunicationPerformanceController` - API endpoints

#### Metrics Available:
- Provider success rates
- Response times
- Queue performance
- Daily volume statistics
- Recent failures analysis

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Synchronous Communication (Small Batches)
```php
// For small batches (< 50 recipients)
$results = $communicationService->sendBulkMessages(
    $branch,
    $recipients,
    'email',
    $subject,
    $content,
    $template,
    $user
);
```

### Asynchronous Communication (Large Batches)
```php
// For large batches (50+ recipients)
$batch = $communicationService->sendBulkMessagesAsync(
    $branch,
    $recipients,
    'email',
    $subject,
    $content,
    $template,
    $user
);

// Monitor batch progress
$batch->id; // Batch ID for tracking
```

### Email Campaigns
```php
// Synchronous (small campaigns)
$processed = $campaignService->processDueCampaignEmails();

// Asynchronous (large campaigns)
$batch = $campaignService->processDueCampaignEmailsAsync();
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/communication-performance/metrics` - Provider metrics
- `GET /api/communication-performance/daily-volume` - Daily statistics
- `GET /api/communication-performance/queue-metrics` - Queue performance
- `GET /api/communication-performance/recent-failures` - Recent failures
- `GET /api/communication-performance/summary` - Complete overview

### Console Commands
```bash
# Process campaigns synchronously
php artisan campaigns:process

# Process campaigns asynchronously (recommended)
php artisan campaigns:process-async

# Run queue worker
php artisan queue:work --tries=3 --timeout=60
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Queue Configuration
Your `config/queue.php` is properly configured for database queues:

```php
'default' => env('QUEUE_CONNECTION', 'database'),
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env`:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
DB_QUEUE_TABLE=jobs
DB_QUEUE_RETRY_AFTER=90
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Start Queue Worker
```bash
# Development
php artisan queue:work

# Production (use supervisor)
php artisan queue:work --tries=3 --timeout=60 --sleep=3
```

### 3. Schedule Commands
The scheduler is already configured in `routes/console.php`:

```php
// Runs every 5 minutes
Schedule::command('campaigns:process-async')->everyFiveMinutes();
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
Access performance metrics via API or check logs:

```bash
# View queue status
php artisan queue:monitor

# View failed jobs
php artisan queue:failed
```

## 📈 Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization:
- ❌ Synchronous processing blocked requests
- ❌ No retry logic for API failures
- ❌ No timeout handling
- ❌ Memory issues with large batches
- ❌ No performance monitoring

### After Optimization:
- ✅ Asynchronous processing with queues
- ✅ 3-retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ 30-second timeouts for all API calls
- ✅ Chunked processing prevents memory issues
- ✅ Comprehensive performance monitoring
- ✅ Real-time batch progress tracking
- ✅ Detailed logging with execution times

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Logs to Monitor:
- `storage/logs/laravel.log` - General application logs
- Queue job logs with execution times
- API response time logs
- Batch completion/failure logs

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **Success Rate**: Should be > 95%
- **Response Time**: Should be < 2 seconds
- **Queue Depth**: Should be minimal
- **Failed Jobs**: Should be < 1%

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Queue Jobs Not Processing**
   ```bash
   # Check queue worker is running
   php artisan queue:work --verbose
   ```

2. **High Memory Usage**
   - Jobs are chunked to prevent this
   - Monitor with `php artisan queue:monitor`

3. **API Timeouts**
   - Retry logic handles temporary failures
   - Check provider status if persistent

4. **Failed Jobs**
   ```bash
   # Retry failed jobs
   php artisan queue:retry all
   
   # View failed job details
   php artisan queue:failed
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Use the async commands
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check metrics regularly
3. **Scale Queue Workers**: Add more workers for high volume
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Monitor success rates and failures
5. **Optimize Further**: Based on actual usage patterns

Your communication system is now production-ready with enterprise-level performance and monitoring capabilities! 🚀
