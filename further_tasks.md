This is the form the guests fill when they attend our service for the first time. 

We are thinking of allowing the guests to register (fill the form), with basic information and be able to fill the rest once they login. (check hwo Member and Account creations works.)

Once they filled the form, they are logged in and presented with a Wizard-like form for them to complete the rest. For those who wont fill the rest, they will still be able to update the records in the Profile Edit. So all these fields, along with others in the current Add Member form should be updatable in the Profile. 

The only part that can't be updated by the Member is the Growth Level, Member Status, Leadership Trainings, and TECI Status
 

I am thinking that Each Pastor should be able to customize this form for their branch, when the guests submit, the details are added to members and users table. this is the same form we would love to use to add new members at the backend, we use the same form to import users. On the current system, we have the Add Member form, can we transform the form to this? 

Create a simple landing page for this application. to replace the current landng page. A simple 

Send the user the login details via email

Send a welcome to Our church email (tempate to be editable by Pastor)

Pastor can send SMS or email to a single user or all members.

Admin can setup email sending via smtp or api and set up email simple template html (with parameters)

The guest can get scheduled emails (do you think this is better done using an email platform like kit.com?)

We need a LifeGroups landing page to be shown to public users, filterable by type, location, branch and searchable.

Then can be directed •⁠  ⁠Join LifeGroup
•⁠  ⁠⁠Attend Memebership Class
•⁠  ⁠⁠If they are interested in serving, join a team.

Give me a detailes breadown of these tasks and how you would implement them without breaking all the working features already.
